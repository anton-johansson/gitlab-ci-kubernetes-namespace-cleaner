# Gitlab CI Kubernetes namespace cleaner

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/anton-johansson/gitlab-ci-kubernetes-namespace-cleaner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/anton-johansson/gitlab-ci-kubernetes-namespace-cleaner)

If you are using Gitlab to automatically deploy to Kubernetes using Gitlab CI and Gitlab environments, you might have noticed that when environments (deployments) are removed, the `Namespace` resource will stay around forever. Gitlab simply does not remove it (yet). There is an official issue for this that you can find [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/27501). Until the issue is resolved, this cleaning tool might help you out! It's a simple tool, written in Golang, that can be deployed to your cluster as a `CronJob` that removes these stale namespaces on a daily basis.

**Note:** This will check all namespaces that matches the pattern `^gitlab-ci-test-.+` and has no running pods and **delete** them. If you have namespaces that matches this pattern that does not run any pods and you want to keep them, **do not run this tool**.
